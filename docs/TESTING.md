# Testing for "go-continuous-fuzz"

## 1. Introduction

Testing is a crucial part of the development process for the
"go-continuous-fuzz" project. This document outlines the
various testing methods employed to ensure the reliability, performance, and
correctness of the project. The methods include Automated Unit and Integration
Testing. Each method is detailed below with examples and instructions on how to run the tests.

## 2. Automated Unit and Integration Testing

### 2.1 Definition and Importance

Automated unit and integration testing involve writing test cases for
individual units of code (functions, methods) and their interactions. These
tests help catch bugs early and ensure that the components work together as
expected.

### 2.2 Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Go Testing Package**: Standard library for writing and running tests in Go.
- **Testify**: A toolkit with assertion and mocking capabilities for Go.
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD tool for automating workflows, including testing.

### 2.3 Test Coverage

Test coverage measures the amount of code being exercised by tests. We aim for
good coverage to ensure robustness.

The current test coverage in the codebase is ~18%.

To generate the test coverage, use the following command:

```bash
make cover
```

### 2.4 Running Unit and Integration Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command in the project root:

```bash
make test
```

Expected output includes all test results pass.
